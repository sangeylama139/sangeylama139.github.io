				<p> Hi there, My name is Sangey Lama. I am originally from Kathmandu, Nepal. I was a very shyee kid who enjoyed outdoor activities, comic books, and playing video games. Playing video games was there most of the times when I was growing up. So, this is how I develop my taste for graphic visuals. The most important key I learned from my journey of learning and understanding design is patience.</p>
