				<p> Hi there, My name is Sangey Lama. I am originally from Kathmandu, Nepal; one of the oldest nations from South Asia. Born and raised at the foothill of Himalayas in Kathmandu valley gives me a great pride and joy. Ever since I was a kid, I must say I was blessed with an ability to read visually. I was a very shyee kid who used to enjoy outdoor activities, comic books, and playing video games. Playing video games was there all the times when I was growing up. So this is how I develop my taste for graphic visuals. In the coarse of developing my visual understanding, I also realized that the most important key I learned from my own experiences is in order to conquer a plan needs a good investigating skill backed by a reasoning.</p>
