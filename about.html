				<p> Namaste! My name is Sangey Lama. I am originally from Nepal, The Kathmandu City; is a junction where an old  meets a new modern society. The city of full of heritage, culture & tradition, architecture, food, music and most importantly the ancient wisdoms passed down from generationt to generation. And on the other hand, the Kathmandu city was a major hub to experience the new modern world and technology. I consider myself very lucky to be raised in the valley because it taught me the old and new way of life. As a kid, I enjoyed outdoor activities, attending cultural and religious acitivities, festivals, visiting old temples and stupas, reading books, and many more. Playing video games, listening to songs on radio, or watching movies and shows on TV were the other things I enjoyed equally. From these experiences, I developed my own taste of who I am and what I can imagine. At the age of 18, I entered America. Thank You America! for letting me be part of this amazing nation which became like a catalyst that heighten my imagination. I settled in New York City and learned so much from this city. The most important thing I learned or say understood how big is the city in graphic design world. I mean the city of full of amazing posters and ads.So, it developed my taste for visually pleasing graphic design. And this is how I entered the graphic design world.
